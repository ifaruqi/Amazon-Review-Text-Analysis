# Amazon-Review-Text-Analysis

In this code I perform text analysis on Amazon Review for grocery and gourmet food category. The dataset is obtained from: https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/![image](https://github.com/ifaruqi/Amazon-Review-Text-Analysis/assets/16346856/8bc80b2a-71b4-4d12-9d9b-f133beb8bc59)

The analysis include the following:
1. A thorough explanation of the text cleaning and normalization process
2. A bag-of-words analysis of the review text such as what are the dominant words per star rating category
3. Polarity and sentiment of the review text
4. Predictive model to predict product rating based on the variable obtained by review text
5. Topic modelling: finding dominant topics in satisfied and dissatisfied customers
